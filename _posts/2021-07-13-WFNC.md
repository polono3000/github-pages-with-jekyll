WFH -> WFanywhere. This week, in NC.  
Days 1-3 in Rocky Mount, in-laws house, with my 2 kids commingling with their 3 cousins.  
Parenting strategies and standards... vary significantly.  Production is surprisingly good
despite the interruptions and frustrations.
Days 3-5 in Raleigh, a time for nostalgia and building new memories in a place.
Staying at a friends' AirBnB, meeting with friends over food and drink, snapshots of
their lives and places, both aged and adapted.
